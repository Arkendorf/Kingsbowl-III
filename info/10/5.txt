If an incompletion occurs or if the ball carrier is tackled, the down ends, and the next down begins. If all four downs are used by the offense, the offense and defense switch roles, and the downs reset. The green “first down line” appears in addition to the line of scrimmage. This line represents the position the offense’s ball carrier must reach to gain a new set of four downs.
