The Kingsbowl is a turn-based game. Players have a set amount of time to input their moves before each turn ends. The exact amount of time is determined in the pre-game settings. At the end of every turn, the number of remaining turns decreases by one, and the game enters the “resolution” phase. During this phase, players’ moves are interpreted and resolved graphically on the screen. When the resolution phase ends, players are once again free to input moves.
