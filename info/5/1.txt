The primary action a player can take during their turn is to move one or more of their knights. However, a knight can only move to a tile within its range. When hovering over a tile, a green path will appear between a knight and the tile if the knight can move to it. However, if the tile is not valid, a red “X” will appear, and all valid tiles will be outlined in yellow.
