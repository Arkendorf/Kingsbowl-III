The other action a player can take is to activate one or more of their knights’ abilities. A knight cannot use an ability and move during the same turn. There are three types of abilities: attacking, blocking, and throwing. Quarterbacks are able to throw, knights on offense are able to block, knights on defense are able to attack, and knights who have caught the ball cannot use an ability. Additionally, abilities cannot be used at the start of a down. (See the “Rules” tab for more information)
