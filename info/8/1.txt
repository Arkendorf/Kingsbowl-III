There are six buttons found at the bottom of the screen during gameplay. The button featuring a square with four adjacent arrows is the “movement” button. Clicking this button allows you to set a new position for your knight by clicking a tile. The movement button’s keyboard shortcut is the “1” key. (See the “Player Movement” tab for more information)
