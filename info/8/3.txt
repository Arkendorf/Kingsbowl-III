The “ability” button is directly to the right of the movement button. Clicking this button allows you to activate your knight’s ability. The ability button’s keyboard shortcut is the “2” key. The “ability” button cannot be used if the knight is not the quarterback but is carrying the ball. (See the “Using Abilities” tab for more information)
