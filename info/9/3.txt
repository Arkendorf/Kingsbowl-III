At the beginning of every down, players will be able to select a starting position for their knights on their respective side of the line of scrimmage. Valid positions are outlined in yellow. The offense also has the option of starting a knight on the “quarterback tile”, which is outlined in green and marked by an arrow. The knight starting on this tile will become the quarterback for the ensuing down, and will be able to throw the ball. If no knight elects to start on the quarterback tile, the nearest knight will be forced to occupy it.
